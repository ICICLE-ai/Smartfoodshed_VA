# Smartfoodshed Visual Analytics VC1 (Version 1)
Visual analytics system built for smart food shed, especially for PPOD and Cold Chain data
## Description 
Our system offers a dynamic and engaging way to explore graph data. It is equipped with three main views, the **Graph View**, **Table View**, and **Map View**, providing a comprehensive and multi-perspective analysis of the data. 

    ![Main View](https://github.com/ICICLE-ai/Smartfoodshed_VA_VC1/blob/main/frontend/src/assets/mainView.png?raw=true)

* The **Graph View** is designed to provide an intuitive understanding of the relationships and patterns within the graph data. 
* The **Table View** and **Map View** offer alternative ways to view the data, providing different insights and perspectives. 
  
The system also allows for bi-directional interaction between the Graph View and the other two views, enabling users to seamlessly switch between the different perspectives and gain a deeper understanding of the data.

### Local Deployment (with docker)
There is a [Makefile](https://github.com/ICICLE-ai/Smartfoodshed_VA_VC1/blob/main/Makefile) in the root of this repostory and it provides utilities for docker local deployment.
1. You must ensure `docker`, `docker-compose`, and `make` are installed.
2. Run `make` while your current directory is the repo root.
    - This should descibe the make targets available and their purpose, the Makefile is simple, read it to understand exactly what actions are being taken.
3. To deploy, you can run `make down up`
    - Note that `up` also runs `build`, building images and then deploying the stack via a docker-compose file.
4. You can adjust urls, credentials, and ports in the [docker-compose.yml file](https://github.com/ICICLE-ai/Smartfoodshed_VA_VC1/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) via environment variables and compose variables.

### CI/CD Information
V1 and V2 Repos have github actions for CI/CD, these are defined in `repo:.github/workflows/<action name>.yml`. Currently (February 2023), when there is a new commit to to `main` branch, the action will build required images and deploy them to the Tapis Pods Service. [More words on how it works in the actual yaml files located here.](https://github.com/ICICLE-ai/Smartfoodshed_VA_VC1/blob/main/.github/workflows/main-build-push-deploy-images.yml)
